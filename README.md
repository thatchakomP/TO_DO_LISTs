# TO DO LIST Exam
Python version: 2.7.15
robotframework: 3.2.1
robotframework-selenium2library: 3.0.0

I have set selenium speed as 0.5s at LoadBrowser.robot file to make it run slower 

For this project, I implement by using 3 libraries which are:
- Selenium2Library => for doing simple keyword on web testing
- Collections => for keeping the data in a list
- String => for generating random string to do data testing
